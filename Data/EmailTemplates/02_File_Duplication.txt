Hello Bot Supervisor,

While attempting to run the Moneysoft Payroll Manager process, I found an input file in the PROCESSING folder; this means that something happen when I last ran the process and the process execution was not complete.

At the moment, there is an input file in the INCOMING folder and this creates a conflict. You will have to make a decision:

1. To continue with the last unsuccessful run, remove the input file currently in the Incoming folder. (This is recommended).
2. To do a fresh run, remove the input file in the PROCESSING folder into the ARCHIVE folder; but note that this is NOT a recommended course of action.

Kindly run the process when you have chosen the Input File you want me to work with.


Thank you.
